Running traffic in a Docker container
-------------------------------------

It is quite simple to run the traffic library in a Docker container. The following two examples show how you can use the traffic library in a docker with `jupyter notebook <https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. If you are completely unfamiliar with Docker and how to modify a Docker image, you can find a good tutorial in the `official documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`__. Of course, you can base your Docker container on a different Dockerfile as the one used in the examples.

Basic Docker container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the simplest case when you just want to run the traffic library in a Docker container, you can install the library and its dependencies directly into the base environment of the container. In that case, the ``Dockerfile`` could look like the following:

.. code:: dockerfile

    FROM jupyter/minimal-notebook

    USER jovyan
    RUN conda install -c conda-forge traffic

To run this Docker, you first have to generate an image with ``docker build``:

.. code:: bash

    docker build -f Dockerfile -t jupyter/traffic:latest .

The Docker container can now be started: 

.. code:: bash

	docker run -it -p 8888:8888 --name jupyter_traffic jupyter/traffic:latest

Docker container using a conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maybe you have already a working conda environment that you would like to use. In this case, you can install your existing environment into the Docker container. The ``Dockerfile`` could looks like the following:

.. code:: dockerfile

    FROM jupyter/minimal-notebook

    # copy miniconda files to image
    COPY traffic_env.yml traffic_env.yml

    # install nb_conda into the base python to allow the user to choose the environment in the jupyter notebook and install environment
    USER jovyan
    RUN conda install -y nb_conda
    RUN conda env create -f traffic_env.yml

Note that the environment file ``traffic_env.yml`` has to be in the same directory as the ``Dockerfile``. The file ``traffic_env.yml`` could look like the following:

.. code:: yaml

    name: traffic_env
    channels:
      - conda-forge
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python
      - traffic
