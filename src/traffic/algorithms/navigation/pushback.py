class ParkingAreaBasedPushback:
    """
    Detects and calculates pushback and taxiing characteristics for a given aircraft trajectory during takeoff.

    This function determines whether an aircraft has performed a pushback before taxiing by checking if the
    trajectory intersects defined stand areas. If pushback is detected, it calculates the start and duration of
    pushback, the start time of taxiing, as well as taxi duration and distance. It also updates the trajectory
    data with pushback and taxi attributes.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    traj : Trajectory
        The aircraft trajectory object containing time series data of the aircraft's ground movement and status.

    standAreas : list of Polygon
        List of polygonal areas representing possible stand locations where aircraft might initiate pushback.

    airport_str : str, optional
        String representing the airport code (default is 'LSZH') for location-specific data handling.

    Returns:
    --------
    traj : Trajectory
        Updated trajectory object with additional attributes:
        - isPushback (bool): Whether the aircraft performed a pushback.
        - startPushback (datetime): The start time of the pushback maneuver, if detected.
        - startTaxi (datetime): The start time of the taxiing phase.
        - pushbackDuration (timedelta): Duration of the pushback phase.
        - taxiDuration (timedelta): Duration of the taxiing phase.
        - taxiDistance (float): Total distance covered during taxiing in meters.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The function is specifically designed for analyzing takeoff events.
    - If the ground coverage is incomplete or trajectory segments are missing,
      adjustments may be made to the pushback and taxi timings.
    - The calculated `taxiDuration` and `taxiDistance` are only valid for takeoff movements
      with available lineup times.

    Example:
    --------
