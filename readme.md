The traffic library helps working with common sources of air traffic data.

Its main purpose is to offer basic cumbersome data analysis methods commonly
applied to trajectories and ATC sectors. When a specific function is not
provided, the access to the underlying structure is direct, through an attribute
pointing to a pandas dataframe.

The library also offers facilities to parse and/or access traffic data from open
sources of ADS-B traffic like the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/)
or Eurocontrol DDR files. It is designed to be easily extendable to other
sources of data.

Static visualisation (images) exports are accessible via Matplotlib/Cartopy.
More dynamic visualisation frameworks are easily accessible in Jupyter
environments with [ipyleaflet](http://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/) and
[altair](http://altair-viz.github.io/); or through exports to other formats,
including CesiumJS or Google Earth.

## Installation

### Latest release

You may install `traffic` in a fresh conda environment:

```sh
# Recommended options if not set up yet
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Installation
conda create -n traffic -c conda-forge python=3.9 traffic
```

Adjust the Python version (>=3.7) and append packages you may need for future works (e.g. `bpython`, `jupyterlab`, etc.)

Then activate the environment each time you need to use the `traffic` library:

```sh
conda activate traffic
```

**Warning:**

Please only report installation issues in fresh conda environments.

#### How to use Traffic with Conda

Simply download miniconda, install `anaconda-navigator` using the command `conda install anaconda-navigator` in a conda promt. Then open the anaconda navigator and select `traffic` on the `Applications on` list. After that install VSCode or any other IDE and launch it.

### Updating traffic

```sh
# -n option is followed by the name of the environment
conda update -n traffic -c conda-forge traffic
```


### Development version

You may also install or update `traffic` in an existing environment with pip:

```sh
pip install --upgrade traffic
```

For the most recent development version, clone the Github repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xoolive/traffic
cd traffic
pip install .[dev]
```

If you intend to file a pull request, please activate `pre-commit` hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

[documentation section](https://traffic-viz.github.io/installation.html#troubleshooting).

## Tests and code quality

[![tests](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

[![Checked with mypy](https://img.shields.io/badge/mypy-checked-blue.svg)](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)

Unit and non-regression tests are written in the `tests/` directory. You may
run `pytest` from the root directory.

Tests are checked on [Github Actions](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)
platform upon each commit. Latest status and coverage are displayed with
standard badges hereabove.

In addition, code is checked against static typing with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)
([pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks are available in the repository) and
extra quality checks performed by [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/manual/xoolive/traffic).

## Command line tool

The `traffic` tool scripts around the library for common usecases.

The most basic use case revolves around exploring the embedded data. You may check
the help with `traffic data -h`.

```
traffic data -p Tokyo
     altitude country iata  icao   latitude   longitude                                name
3820       21   Japan  HND  RJTT  35.552250  139.779602  Tokyo Haneda International Airport
3821      135   Japan  NRT  RJAA  35.764721  140.386307  Tokyo Narita International Airport
```

## Feedback and contribution

Any input, feedback, bug report or contribution is welcome.

Should you encounter any issue, you may want to file it in the [issue](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic/issues/new) section of this repository. Please first activate the `DEBUG` messages recorded using Python logging mechanism with the following snippet:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

Bug fixes and improvements in the library are also helpful.

If you share a fix together with the issue, I can include it in the code for
you. But since you did the job, pull requests (PR) let you keep the authorship
on your additions. For details on creating a PR see GitHub documentation
[Creating a pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). You can
add more details about your example in the PR such as motivation for the example
or why you thought it would be a good addition. You will get feedback in the PR
discussion if anything needs to be changed. To make changes continue to push
commits made in your local example branch to origin and they will be
automatically shown in the PR.

You may find the process troublesome but please keep in mind it is actually
easier that way to keep track of corrections and to remember why things are the
way they are.

- I want to know more about Eurocontrol NM files

We download these files from Eurocontrol [Network Manager Demand Data
Repository (DDR)](https://www.eurocontrol.int/ddr) under Dataset Files >
Airspace Environment Datasets. [Access
conditions](https://www.eurocontrol.int/ddr#access-conditions) are managed by
EUROCONTROL.

Should you have no such access, basic FIRs are provided in `eurofirs` from
`traffic.data`.

- I want to know more about Eurocontrol AIXM files

When you import `aixm_airspaces` from `traffic.data`, you need to set a path
to a directory containing AIRAC files. These are XML files following the
[AIXM](http://aixm.aero/) standard and produced by Eurocontrol. We download
these files from Eurocontrol [Network Manager B2B web
services](https://eurocontrol.int/service/network-manager-business-business-b2b-web-services).
You have to own a B2B certificate granted by EUROCONTROL to get access to
this data.

- What does AIRAC mean?

Aeronautical Information Publications are updated every 28 days according to
fixed calendar. This cycle is known as AIRAC (Aeronautical Information
Regulation And Control) cycle.
